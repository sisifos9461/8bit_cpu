# 8bit_cpu of PYNQ

build a 8bit cpu by verilog with instruction `mov,add,sub,jump,jump if greater,out and halt`.

the main is `add`,  branch accumulate contains `jump` ,branch subtraction contains `sub`.

the constrains PYNQ-Z1_C.xdc is utility. you can implement the code to the PYNQ by synthesis and implement and generate bitstream
