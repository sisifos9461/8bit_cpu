# 8bit_cpu
build a 8bit cpu by verilog with instruction mov,add,sub,jump,jump if greater,out and halt.
the main is add,  branch accumulate contains jump ,branch subtraction contains sub.
the constrains PYNQ-Z1_C.xdc is utility. you can implement the code to the PYNQ by synthesis and implement and generate bitstream.
